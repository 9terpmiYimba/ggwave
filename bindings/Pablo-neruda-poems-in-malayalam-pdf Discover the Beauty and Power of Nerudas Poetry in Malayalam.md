One of his admirers was K. Satchidanandan, a prominent Malayalam poet and critic. He translated some of Neruda's poems into Malayalam and published them in a book titled *Neeradum Kadaludutha* (The Sea that Carries the Clouds) in 1982. The book contains 25 poems selected from different collections of Neruda, such as *Twenty Poems of Love and a Song of Despair*, *Residence on Earth*, *Canto General*, *Elemental Odes*, and *The Captain's Verses*.
 
Satchidanandan's translations capture the essence and beauty of Neruda's poetry, while also adapting them to the cultural and linguistic context of Malayalam. He uses rich imagery, musical rhythm, and lyrical expressions to convey Neruda's emotions and thoughts. He also adds some notes and introductions to explain the background and significance of each poem.
 
The book was well received by Malayalam readers and critics, who appreciated Satchidanandan's skill and sensitivity as a translator. It also introduced Neruda's poetry to a wider audience in Kerala, where he is still admired and celebrated as a poet of love, nature, and revolution.

Pablo Neruda was born in 1904 in Parral, Chile. His original name was NeftalÃ­ Ricardo Reyes Basoalto, but he adopted the pen name Pablo Neruda after the Czech poet Jan Neruda. He started writing poetry at an early age and published his first book, *Crepusculario* (Twilight), in 1923. His second book, *Twenty Poems of Love and a Song of Despair*, published in 1924, made him famous and established him as a romantic poet.
 
Neruda was also involved in politics and diplomacy. He joined the Communist Party of Chile in 1945 and became a senator. He also served as a consul in various countries, such as Spain, France, Mexico, and Burma. He was a friend and supporter of Salvador Allende, the socialist president of Chile who was overthrown by a military coup in 1973. Neruda died of cancer shortly after the coup, but his death was also surrounded by controversy and suspicion of foul play.
 
Neruda's poetry is diverse and prolific. He wrote more than 3,000 poems in his lifetime, covering themes such as love, nature, history, politics, art, and death. He experimented with different forms and styles, such as sonnets, odes, free verse, and surrealist imagery. He was influenced by various literary movements and traditions, such as modernism, symbolism, surrealism, romanticism, and Latin American folklore. He also incorporated elements from his personal life and experiences into his poetry.
