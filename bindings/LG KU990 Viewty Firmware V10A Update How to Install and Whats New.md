**DOWNLOAD ✔✔✔ [https://glycoltude.blogspot.com/?l=2uF6pj](https://glycoltude.blogspot.com/?l=2uF6pj)**


 
1. Download the firmware file V10A\_04.kdz from [this link](https://lg-firmwares.com/downloads-file/12071/V10A_04). This is the official firmware for the LG Viewty KU990I model for the region ERA from Poland. Make sure your phone model matches this one before proceeding. You can check your phone model by dialing \*#06# and looking at the IMEI number.
2. Download the LG UP tool from [this link](https://lg-firmwares.com/how-to-flash/). This is a software that allows you to flash stock firmware on LG phones. You can choose either LG UP 1.14 or LG UP 1.16 depending on your PC compatibility.
3. Extract the KDZ firmware file and the LG UP tool to your PC. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this.
4. Turn off your phone and enter download mode. To do this, press and hold the Volume Up key and then connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable.
5. Open LG UP and choose "Upgrade". Then select your KDZ file and click on "Start". Wait for the process to complete. Your phone will reboot and disconnect from the PC when done.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your LG KU990 Viewty firmware to V10A. You can now enjoy improved performance and stability on your phone.
  
If you encounter any problems or errors while updating your firmware, you can try the following troubleshooting tips:

- Make sure your phone battery is fully charged before starting the update. A low battery can cause the update to fail or damage your phone.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection and enough storage space on your PC. A corrupted or incomplete download can cause the update to fail or damage your phone.
- Make sure you use the original USB cable and port that came with your phone. A faulty or incompatible cable or port can cause the update to fail or damage your phone.
- Make sure you do not disconnect or turn off your phone or PC during the update process. This can cause the update to fail or damage your phone.
- If the update fails or your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, you can try to flash the firmware again using the LG Flash Tool 2014. You can download it from [this link](https://lg-firmwares.com/how-to-flash/) and follow the same steps as above, but choose "CSE Flash" instead of "Upgrade". This will erase all your data and settings on your phone, so make sure you back up your important files before doing this.

If none of these tips work, you can contact LG customer service or visit a nearby LG service center for further assistance.
